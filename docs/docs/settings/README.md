# Settings

This is where you will find global Sass variables such as colors, fonts and typesetting, and breakpoint variables used within media queries.

## Breakpoints

Number variables corresponding to generic viewport measurements, and used within media query mixins. These values can be updated and new variables added as required for your project's needs.

The `$text-measure` variable is used to limit the maximum line length of text content for [improved readability](http://webtypography.net/2.1.2).

## Colors

A limited range of prototyping colors, a custom color palette specific to your project, and common social media brand colors.

### Color contrast

Make sure that the contrast ratio of text and interactive elements on your site meets at least level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum), preferably level AAA. The ideal contrast range is 7:1 - 15:1. Higher contrasts can be triggering for certain people.

### Color palette

We advise you to use the Sass variables provided, rather than copying the hexadecimal (hex) color values. This will ensure that, in the event of a CSS update, your site will continue to use the most recent color palette.

Only use the variables in the context theyâ€™re designed for. In all other cases, you should reference the colour palette directly. For example, `$blue` is used as the default link color; if you want to use it for an additional purpose you should use `$blue` rather than `$link-color`.

## Debug

`$pesticide` is a useful variable which, when enabled, can help you [debug your CSS layouts](https://github.com/mrmrs/pesticide).

## Fonts

Custom fonts are defined here using the `@font-face` CSS at-rule.

## Paths

Variables for commonly used paths to asset directories.

## Typesetting

Variables for font families and weights.

### Avoiding flash of invisible text (FOIT)

Apollo uses [Bram Stein's](https://github.com/bramstein) [Font Face Observer](https://fontfaceobserver.com/) web font loader to optimise font loading and prevent (FOIT).

The default font stack is limited to a choice of system fonts similar to the desired web font. Use [CSS Font Stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) and [Font Style Matcher](https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/) to help pick suitable system fonts. This will [minimise the flash of un-styled content (FOUC)](https://helenvholmes.com/writing/type-is-your-right/).

Font Face Observer detects when the `@font-face` files are loaded and adds the `.fonts-loaded` class to the `html` root element, at which point the web font will be used.
