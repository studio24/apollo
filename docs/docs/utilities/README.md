# Utilities

A utility class applies a single rule or a very simple, universal pattern.

In the context of Apollo, utility classes are used as overrides or helper classes. As such, they could apply to any element and in any context, to do exactly the same thing each time. They are always prefixed with `u-`, e.g. `.u-float-left` or `.u-full-width`.

Utility classes are organised into groups with a similar purpose or remit, as detailed below. If you have a requirement that you feel would be best covered by a utility class that does not yet exist, feel free to add to the current selection available in Apollo.

## Alignments

For floating items to left or right and overriding default text alignment.

## Clearfix

Forces an element to self-clear its children.

## Layout

To create a full-viewport-width element inside a limited width parent, and to horizontally center a block-level item.

## Margins

For removing all margins or just the top margin from an element.
