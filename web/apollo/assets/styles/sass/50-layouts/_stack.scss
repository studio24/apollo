/**
Applying vertical spacing between items via a class gives us more fine-tuned
control over where we choose to include it.

The suggested base measurement for the stack matches the base line-height
as defined in /40-base/typography.

By giving `.stack` Flexbox context, we can give it the ability to add an
auto margin to a chosen element. This way, we can choose to group elements
inside the stack to the top/bottom of the vertical space using auto margins,
which is useful for card-like components.
