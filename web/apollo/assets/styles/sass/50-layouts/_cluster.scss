    #Cluster layout primitive

    From https://absolutely.every-layout.dev/layouts/cluster/

    `.l-cluster` suits any groups of elements that differ in length and
    are liable to wrap. Buttons that appear together at the end of forms
    are ideal candidates, as well as lists of tags, keywords, or other
    meta information. Use the Cluster to align any groups of horizontally
    laid out elements to the left or right, or in the center, with even
    spacing between elements.

    The size variable used below defines the desired spacing between
    elements inside `.l-cluster` (currently 1rem). Sizes are defined
    in /10-settings/sizes

    If items need to be in wrapping rows in IE9, use the alternative
    `.inline-list` class as defined in /40-base/lists

/**
We use flexbox to configure the elements into clusters without having to
deal with undesirable word spaces. It also gives us control of how we align
items within the cluster, with 'align-items` and `justify-content` if desired.

1. Multiply by -1 to create negative margins to pull the items back to the
edges.
